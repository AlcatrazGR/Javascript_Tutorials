			Bootstrap provides multiple different text tags that make the web page more dynamic
			and beautiful. <br/> <br/>
			<hr>
			Bootstrap provides sub title texts by using the tag 'small' inside the header (h1...h6) tags.
			The bigger the header tag the bigger the sub text will be. Ofcourse u can change the size
			of the sub text manually using CSS styling and 'font-size' attribute.
			<h1> This is a h1 title <small> This is a sub title text... </small> </h1>
			<h2> This is a h2 title <small> This is a sub title text... </small> </h2>
			<h3> This is a h3 title <small> This is a sub title text... </small> </h3>
			<h4> This is a h4 title <small> This is a sub title text... </small> </h4>
			<h5> This is a h5 title <small> This is a sub title text... </small> </h5>
			<h6> This is a h6 title <small> This is a sub title text... </small> </h6>
			<hr>
			Bootstrap also provides the 'mark' tag to <mark> mark text inside your web page </mark>
			<hr>
			Bootstrap provides the tag 'abbr' to show a point of description. For example if in 
			your page you use arconyms for companies or organisation (<abbr style="font-size: 20px;"
			title="Hyper Text Markup Language"> HTML </abbr>) you can use this tag to explaing to the user the definition of the acronym. 
			By mouse over the area a popup will appear with the description of the acronym. The 
			description of the acronym is placed inside the 'title' attribute of the abbr tag.
			<hr>
			Bootstrap provides blockquote tag. The blockquote element is used to present content 
			from another source: <br/><br/>
			<blockquote>
				For 50 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature. The world's leading conservation organization, 
				WWF works in 100 countries and is supported by 1.2 million members in the United States and close to 
				5 million globally.
				<footer>From WWF's website</footer>
			</blockquote>
			The source of the quote inside the blockquote tag is defined through the 'footer' tag. As blockquote
			exists in bootstrap also blockquote-reverse exists which flips horizontally the text to the other side.
			<blockquote class="blockquote-reverse">
				For 50 years, WWF has been protecting the future of nature. The world's leading conservation organization, 
				WWF works in 100 countries and is supported by 1.2 million members in the United States and close to 
				5 million globally.
				<footer>From WWF's website</footer>
			</blockquote>
			<span style="color: red; border: 2px solid red; border-radius: 5px; padding: 10px;">
				<b> !Important, </b> The blockquote-reverse is <mark> NOT </mark> a tag element, but a class which
				is defined inside the blockquote tag.
			</span>
			<hr>
			Bootstrap provides a tag called 'code' to display and tone certain words, for example : <br>
			The tag <code> table </code> is used to create tables in a DOM file. <br/>
			The tag <code> form </code> defines an area of object which will react as a form to send and 
			receive data.
			<hr>
			Bootstrap provides classes for line coloring by the names bg-primary, bg-success, bg-info, bg-warning,
			bg-danger. This is very useful and can help to point out thing to the user in a certain manner. <br/>
			<p class="bg-primary">This text is important.</p>
			<p class="bg-success">This text indicates success.</p>
			<p class="bg-info">This text represents some information.</p>
			<p class="bg-warning">This text represents a warning.</p>
			<p class="bg-danger">This text represents danger.</p>
			<hr>
			Finally another thing we will cover is the .pre-scrollable class which enables a text inside
			the 'pre' tags to be scrolled by the user.
			<pre class="pre-scrollable" style="width: 80%; margin-left: 10%;">
				<blockquote>
					You may write me down in history
					With your bitter, twisted lies,
					You may tread me in the very dirt
					But still, like dust, I'll rise.

					Does my sassiness upset you? 
					Why are you beset with gloom? 
					'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells
					Pumping in my living room.

					Just like moons and like suns,
					With the certainty of tides,
					Just like hopes springing high,
					Still I'll rise.

					Did you want to see me broken? 
					Bowed head and lowered eyes? 
					Shoulders falling down like teardrops.
					Weakened by my soulful cries.

					Does my haughtiness offend you? 
					Don't you take it awful hard
					'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines
					Diggin' in my own back yard.

					You may shoot me with your words,
					You may cut me with your eyes,
					You may kill me with your hatefulness,
					But still, like air, I'll rise.

					Does my sexiness upset you? 
					Does it come as a surprise
					That I dance like I've got diamonds
					At the meeting of my thighs? 

					Out of the huts of history's shame
					I rise
					Up from a past that's rooted in pain
					I rise
					I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide,
					Welling and swelling I bear in the tide.
					Leaving behind nights of terror and fear
					I rise
					Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear
					I rise
					Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave,
					I am the dream and the hope of the slave.
					I rise
					I rise
					I rise. 
					<footer> Maya Angelou </footer>
