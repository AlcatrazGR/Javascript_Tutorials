							In the past there wasn't any standard / technology for 
							playing audio in a web page and the only way was top
							be played with a plug-in such as flash player. Now with HTML 5
							there is a new element called audio in which we can specify
							a standard way to embed an audio file inside our web page.
							<br/><br/> <b> Sea_Rising_Tide.mp3 </b> 
							<audio controls>
								<source src="Sea_Rising_Tide.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
								Your browser does not support the audio element.
							</audio>
						</td>

						<td class="textTitle"> How it works ? </td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="textContent"> 
							The controls attribute inside the audio element provides controls
							such as start, stop button and more. With the line : 
							<u>source src="horse.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"</u> the source path
							of the audio file is initialized, where src is the source path
							and type is the file type. We can use this particullar line
							more than once inside the audio element in which line the
							only thing that is different from the others is the extension
							(provided that we already have the audio file on the specific
							file extension). That way if a audio file is not recognized / 
							supported by the browser it moves on the next line (source file).
							If none of the source paths is supported by the browser then a 
							message is displayed that we setted on the end of the audio 
							element.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="textTitle"> Controls & AutoPlay </td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="textContent"> 
							As we mentioned above the controls attribute that is located
							inside the audio element sets a number of controls such as 
							play button, stop button, volume button and more into the 
							audio file. The autoplay attribute can be used insted of controls
							and that makes the audio file play automatically as long as
							the web page is fully loaded.
