							In the past there wasn't any standard / technology for 
							showing videos inside a web page and the only way was top
							be played with a plug-in such as flash player. Now with HTML 5
							there is a new element called video in which we can specify
							a standard way to embed a video inside our web page.
							
							<video width="320" height="240" controls>
								<source src="When mom isn't home... Funny Vine.mp4" type="video/mp4">
								Your browser does not support the video tag.
							</video>
						</td>

						<td class="textTitle"> How it works ? </td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="textContent"> 
							The attribute controls that is located inside the element
							video add controls into the video such as play button, stop
							button, volume button and more. The attributes width and height
							indicate the width and height of the specific video, bare in
							mind that we must keep the analogies of the video otherwise
							it might look corrupted. The line :  
							<u>source src="When mom isn't home... Funny Vine.mp4" type="video/mp4"</u>
							sets the source path of the video, we can use this particular line
							multiple times with each time the extension of the video changes
							(supposed that we have the video on the extension that we set).
							That way if a browser doesn't support lets say MP4 videos then
							it moves on the next line which maybe OGG and maybe is supported
							by the browser.
						</td>

					<tr>
						<td class="textTitle"> AutoPlay & Controls </td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="textContent"> 
							As we already said the controls attribute inside the video 
							element set controls into the video such as play, stop, 
							volume, size buttons and more. On the other hand there is
							also the attribute autoplay, this attributes sets no controls
							into the video but makes it start automatically whenever the
							page is fully loaded.
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="textTitle"> Track Attribute </td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="textContent"> 
							With HTML 5 besides all the above attributes that have been 
							added in order to make the embed of videos easier there is also
							an element called track. With track we can set a certain file 
							into the video which will be subtitles or even a text that 
							we want to be shown at a certain time. In this example we wont
							use any subtitles for our video but there is a very helpful
							documentation of this element on W3CSchools 
							('<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_track.asp"> Track Tutorial </a>')
