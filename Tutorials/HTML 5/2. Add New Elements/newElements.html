			One of the best key features that HTML 5 provides is the 
			creation of new elements/tags by the user. Those new elements/tags
			can be taught by the programmer their certain behaviour. To do that the
			only thing that we must do is create a selector on css section with
			the name of the new tag that we want to create. After that we can 
			define its style attributes inside the block of the css selector and 
			every time we use the certain tag its going to corespond the same
			way we taught it to. The only extra thing that we can add (but its not
			necessary) is the document.createElement("name of new tag") inside script 
			tags. This javascript code is being used to satisfy the needs of internet
			explorer 6.<br/> <br/>
			In this example we have created two new tags <imba> one is imba which makes the font 
			20pixels, the color red, and underlined </imba> and the other tag is <powerMan> powerMan which makes
			the text bold, brown and verdana. </powerMan> <br/> <br/>
			Another way to solve the problems of internet explorer is to add in 
			script tags the shiv code (<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_browsers.asp"> Shiv Code Example </a>)
			that way IE knows all the new elements.
